batchproc
---------

Simple batch processing framework for scientists and others with lots of files.

Provides a convenient interface to scale up your data processing function to operate on multiple files.

See demo.py for a quick example.

If you compile your script with PyInstaller, you should be able to drag-and-drop files onto the executable to run your
script on those files.
